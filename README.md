# Experiments of Foundations of Cryptography at Fudan University

## Intro to this course

### Staff

The teacher is Prof. Li Jingtao, and Pan Tianyu is the TA. Genrally speaking, the framework of all these code is completed by Pan.

### Content

This course is mainly about the theoretical knowledge of cryptology, we will also implement some encryption algorithms on our own.

 - hw1: Cracking Vigen√®re Cipher
 - hw2: DES&AES
 - hw3: RSA
 - hw4: Needham-Schroeder Protocol
 - hw5: Blockchain.
 
## Details about the experiment

Generally, most of my homeworks will be completed with python. 


What's worth mentioning is that in hw2, we need to operate on terminal to implement AES encryption and in hw5, we will use flask to build a naive web application.
